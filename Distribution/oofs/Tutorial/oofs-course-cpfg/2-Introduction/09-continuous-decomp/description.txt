FRACTAL FERN LEAF - USING DECOMPOSITION

A parametric L-system generating a family of compound 
branching structures that resemble fern leaves.
This model operates in continuous time, with time 
increment dt.  The advancement of time and the elongation 
of internodes are captured by "standard" L-system 
productions.  The creation of a metamer by an apex 
that has reached the threshold age and the components
of metamers are specified by decomposition rules.
