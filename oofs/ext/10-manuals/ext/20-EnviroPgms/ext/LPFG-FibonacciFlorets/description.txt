Canalization of the number of organs in spiral phyllotaxis


The model creates a sequence of flowerheads with an increasing
number of organs, and outputs the number of ray florets ("petals")
to the message window.  Observe that these numbers usually
are Fibonacci numbers.

For each number of organs, the entire phyllotactic pattern 
is created at once, using a decomposition rule. 
Consecutive primordia are assigned increasing vigor values.  
The environment compares the vigor of colliding primordia.  The
primordium with the lower vigor is dominated by the primordium 
with the higher vigor.  The only primordia that are not dominated 
are situated on the circumference of the capitulum (disk). These 
primordia form ray florets, while the remaining
primordia form disk florets.   

NOTE: This model uses the multiple window feature of lpfg to 
simultaneously display two views of the simulation: 
- a representation of the flowerhead
- and a plot showing the canalization of petal numbers.
It interacts with the 'honda81' environmental program to compare the vigor.
