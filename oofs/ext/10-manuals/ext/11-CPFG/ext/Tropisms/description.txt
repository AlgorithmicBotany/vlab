Illustration of basic tropisms: orthotropism, plagiotropism, and 
"twist tropism".  As both orthotropism and plagiotropism act 
on the heading vector, they are not affected by the 
orientation of the up and left vectors.  For the same reason,
the "twist tropism" does not affect the course of the axis.
