Interplay between florigen and auxin

Florigen flows in a growing structure.  The vegetative 
apex is transformed into a flowering bud when the apex is
reached by florigen.  At this time, the apex induces
a second signal that propagates downwards.  This second
signal can be viewed as (the removal of) the auxin - thus
it can be used by the plant to gradually lift the apical
dominance from the top down.

The florigen and the auxin-related signal are represented
by two parameters (f and a) associated with the internodes.
