A monopodial branching structure

So far, we have only considered models with a single 
apex type.  This resulted in highly recursive, polypodial
branching structures.  In reality, different apices may 
have different fates.  In the case of monopodial branching, 
lateral buds produce organs that do not branch further.

This model employs graphically defined growth functions.
Changes in growth functions and related parameters may
modify the outline of the growing structure.
