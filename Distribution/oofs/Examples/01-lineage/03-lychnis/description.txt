Lychnis coronaria - Rose campion

A developmental model based on the L-system on page 84
of the "Algorithmic Beauty of Plants".

This example illustrates construction of a simple 
developmental model expressed using a context-free 
L-system (no information flow between the modules).  
In addition, it illustrates the incorporation of
predefined surfaces into a model.
