A combination of the Borchert and Slade model of 
branching with the pipe model of branch width.

Each apex is characterized by a "vigor" value 
that decreases by a constant factor at each step.  
The vigor value determines the length of (long) shoots.

The main problem now is that the early stages of 
development do not look good - there should be small 
twigs that later fall off.

Parameters (branching angles, internode length and 
width, branching probablities) were chosen 
without much playing - the parameter space should be 
explored.
