Algorithm:

The environment stores all queries in a linked list. The parameter specifies
the vigor of the segment. After all queries are inserted, the program goes 
through the list and computes the distance from a given query to each other
having higher or equal vigor (it means that if a segment end point is
obstructed by a leaflet with lower vigor it would continue growing  - ?E(1)
will always stop growth of other branches). This repeats for each query.

The respond is 0 (can't grow further) or 1 (can grow).
