Light comes a single source, mainly from above.
Colors of the balls indicate the total amount of light received.
The direction of light from viewing (set in the view file) and
for calculation of the amount of received light (in the light.spec
file) are the same.  Nevertheless, this view is somewhat confusing
 because of the lack of shadows.
