<h1>Editors with galleries</h1>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/gallery.png"
     alt="The gallery interface">
</div>

<p>The <a href="#surfaces">surface</a>, <a
href="#contours">contour</a>, <a href="#functions">function</a>, and
<a href="#panels">panel</a> editors share a user interface paradigm:
the <dfn>gallery</dfn>.  At the top left of the editor window is the
<dfn>preview</dfn>; to its right are all of the <dfn>controls</dfn>
for altering it. Below the preview and controls is the gallery. This
is a window which shows all of the surfaces, contours, functions, or
panels (respectively) which are part of the object.</p>

<h4>Working with the gallery</h4>

<p>The gallery lets you see all of the components of a particular
type which are part of the object. Clicking on one will bring it
up in the preview window, where it can be altered with the editing
controls. Right-clicking on the preview window brings up a popup
menu which includes the commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="menu">Apply</em> saves whatever changes have been made
to this component to the version in the gallery. Note that the changes
are also saved to the gallery when you choose another component to
edit.</li>
<li><em class="menu">Retrieve from gallery</em> abandons any changes
you have made to the current component since it was last saved to
the gallery; it brings the version currently in the gallery into the
preview window.</li>
<li><em class="menu">Add as new</em> saves the current component as a
new component added to the end of the gallery.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each component has a <dfn>name</dfn>; a new component's name is
"unnamed". <!--********Add in more here--></p>

<p>Right-clicking in the gallery brings up the gallery popup menu,
which includes the commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="menu">New</em> creates a new component, named "unnamed",
at the end of the gallery.</li>

<li><em class="menu">Delete</em> deletes the currently selected
component. If there is only one entry in the gallery, the <em
class="menu">Reset</em> command replaces <em class="menu">Delete</em>:
it resets the single component to its default state (as if newly
created).</li>

<li><em class="menu">Cut</em>, <em class="menu">Copy</em>, and <em
class="menu">Paste</em> perform basic clipboard operations on the
gallery. <em class="menu">Paste</em> has two sub-options, <em
class="menu">Before</em>, which inserts the copied or cut component to
the left of the currently selected object, and <em
class="menu">After</em>, which inserts it to the right.  Note that if
you <em class="menu">Cut</em> the only component in the gallery, it
will be reset to the default state instead of deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also move a gallery entry by selecting it, then dragging
it to a new position.</p>


<h4>Component sets</h4>

<p>Each panel in the gallery is saved to a file <tt>name.pnl</tt>
on the lab table, where <tt>name</tt> is the name given to the
panel. Panels called "unnamed", however, are <em>not</em> saved.
This is also the default behaviour for surfaces (which are saved
as <tt>name.s</tt>) and contours (<tt>name.con</tt>). However,
surfaces, contours, and functions can be <dfn>bound</dfn> into
<dfn>sets</dfn>, which are saved as single files.
<!--******Why use sets?-->
</p>


<p>The gallery popup menu of the surface, contour, and function
editors has an extra command. <em class="menu">Bind</em> toggles the
state of the components: if on, they are bound to a set; if off, they
will be saved as individual files. Note that if the components have
been saved as individual files, then are bound, the individual files
will not be deleted; similarly, if they are unbound, the set will not
be deleted.</p>


<h2>
<a name="surfaces"></a>
Surfaces</h2>

<p>Surfaces in L-studio are implemented as Bezier patches. There are
two surface editors available: the <dfn>basic</dfn> surface editor,
and the <dfn>advanced</dfn> editor. With the basic editor,
you can edit and manipulate surfaces with a single Bezier patch.
Surfaces made from more than one Bezier patch must be edited
using the advanced editor. To switch between the basic and advanced
editors, press the <em class="button">Advanced</em> or <em
class="button">Basic</em> button in the top right corner of the
editor.</p>

<p>For more information about surfaces in <i>cpfg</i>, see the
<cite>Cpfg User's Manual</cite>. More information can also be
found at <a
href="http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Research/bmv/vlab/ise.html"
>http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Research/bmv/vlab/ise.html</a>.</p>


<h3>
<a name="basicsurfaces"></a>
The basic surface editor</h3>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/basic_surf.png"
     alt="Basic surface editor">
</div>

<h4>The editor window</h4>

<p>In the top left of the editor is the preview window, which shows
the current state of the surface currently being edited. To the right
of the preview window are the controls: the <em
class="button">Advanced</em> button switches to the <a
href="#advancedsurfaces">advanced surface editor</a>; below it is an
array of buttons to select which Bezier patch control point is
currently being edited; and below that is the name of the current
surface. Under the preview window and controls are three sliders which
display (and can be used to set) the X, Y, and Z position of the
currently selected control point. At the bottom of the editor is the
gallery of surfaces. If a gallery entry is in white, it was created
with the advanced editor, and cannot be loaded into the basic editor;
attempting to select such an entry will merely display a message in
the preview window indicating this.</p>


<h4>Manipulating the view</h4>

<p>The preview window can be in one of two modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="mode">Rotate</em></li>
<li><em class="mode">Lock XY</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The default mode is <em class="mode">Rotate</em>. To enter <em
class="mode">Lock XY</em> mode, right-click on the preview window and
select <em class="menu">Lock XY Design</em> from the popup menu. To
return to <em class="mode">Rotate</em> mode, select <em
class="menu">Lock XY Design</em> again.</p>

<p>In <em class="mode">Rotate</em> mode, you can rotate the view of
the surface by dragging on the preview window with the mouse.  To
reset the display to its default parallel projection, right-click on
the preview window and select <em class="menu">Reset rotation</em>
from the popup menu. In <em class="mode">Lock XY</em> mode, the
surface cannot be rotated: it is presented in parallel projection on
the X&ndash;Y plane.</p>

<p>You can pan and zoom the preview window. In both modes, pan by
dragging the mouse while holding the Shift key on the keyboard.  To
zoom in or out, either drag with the middle mouse button, or drag with
the left mouse button while holding the Ctrl key on the
keyboard. Dragging the mouse up zooms in, while dragging down zooms
out.</p>


<h4>Display options</h4>

<p>You can choose to display or not display the control mesh, the
control points, or the control points' numbers. You can also show the
surface in one of three densities of wireframe, or as a shaded
surface. These options are chosen through the <em
class="menu">Display</em> submenu of the preview window's popup menu.


<h4>Modifying the surface</h4>

<p>The surface can be edited in both modes. In <em
class="mode">Rotate</em> mode, select a control point using the
buttons labeled 1&ndash;16. The three sliders located below the
preview window can be used to change the X, Y and Z coordinates of the
selected point. In <em class="mode">Lock XY</em> mode, a control point
can be edited directly by clicking to selct it, then dragging it.
(Note that in <em class="mode">Lock XY</em> mode, you can only drag a
control point within the X&ndash;Y plane; to change its Z coordinate,
select it and use the Z slider.)</p>

<p>You can also change the <dfn>contact point</dfn> associated
with the surface. When <i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i> draws the surface,
the turtle position corresponds to the contact point. See the
<cite>Cpfg User's Manual</cite> for more information.</p>

<p>If you choose the command <em class="menu">Keep symmetric</em> from
the popup menu, any change you make to a control point's position will
be mirrored in point opposite it in the plane defined by the Heading
and Up vectors.  The result of applying <em class="menu">Keep
symmetric</em> to a surface which is not symmetric to start with is
undefined.</p>


<h3>
<a name="advancedsurfaces"></a>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/adv_surf.png"
     alt="Advanced surface editor">
</div>

<p>Again, the preview window is at the top left, the controls are to
its right, and the gallery is at the bottom. The <em
class="button">Basic</em> button, at the top left, switches back to the
<a href="#basicsurfaces">basic surface editor</a>. The button panel
below it offers many controls for editing the surface:</p>

<ul>
<li><img SRC="images/3de/initbspline.jpg" height=26 width=24 alt="Init

<li><img SRC="images/3de/axes.jpg" height=26 width=24 alt="Axes"> <em
class="button">Axes</em> toggles the display of the Cartesian axes.
The red arrow points along the positive X axis, the green arrow points
along the positive Y axis, and the blue arrow points along the
positive Z axis.</li>

<li><img SRC="images/3de/grid.jpg" height=26 width=24 alt="Grid"><em
class="button">Grid</em> opens a submenu which lets you choose which
grids you want to display. You can independently turn on or off the
X&ndash;Y grid, the Y&ndash;Z grid, and the X&ndash;Z grid. Choosing
<em class="menu">Grid</em> from the submenu toggles all active grids
on or off.</li>

<li><img SRC="images/3de/insert.jpg" height=26 width=24 alt="Insert">
<em class="button">Insert</em> brings up a submenu offering three
options:

<ul>
<li><em class="menu">Point</em> inserts a control point. Within the
<em class="menu">Point</em> submenu, <em class="menu">Pred</em>
inserts a point before the currently selected control point, while
<em class="menu">Succ</em> inserts a control point after the
currently selected one.</li>

<li><em class="menu">Surface</em> inserts a Bezier patch. Pick an
option from the submenu to choose the relation of the new patch to the
patch containing the currently selected control point.</li>

<li><em class="menu">Variation</em> inserts a variation.</li>
<!--******What is a variation?-->
</ul>

If no control point is selected, the commands have no effect.
</li>

of several types of B-spline.</li>

<li><img SRC="images/3de/select.jpg" height=26 width=24 alt="Select">
<em class="button">Select</em> opens a submenu which lets you select
every control point, including control points of variations; all
control points on the currently selected curve or surface; or a single
one of the currently selected control points. This last option is
useful if there are several control points close together, and
distinguishing them graphically is difficult.</li>

<li><img SRC="images/3de/align.jpg" height=26 width=24 alt="Align">
<em class="button">Align</em> moves all currently selected control

<!--******Other three buttons??-->
</ul>


<hr>
<h2><a name="contours"></a>
Contours</h2>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/contour_editor.png"
     alt="Contour editor">
</div>

<p>Contours in L-studio are defined by B-spline curves. The contour
editor lets you manipulate the curve's control points; you can
add or delete control points, move them, or change their
<dfn>multiplicity</dfn> (strength of attraction). You can also select
between several types of B-spline curve.</p>


<h4>Selecting the type of curve</h4>

<p>L-studio lets you create contours which are <dfn>closed</dfn> or
<dfn>open</dfn>; to switch between them, check or uncheck the <em
class="button">Closed contour</em> check box, in the top right corner
of the editor. In addition, you can force the B-spline to pass through
the first and last control points by selecting <em
class="button">Endpoint interp.</em> in the <em
class="button">B-spline type</em> group; the normal, non-interpolating
behaviour is selected with the <em class="button">Regular</em> button.


<h4>Manipulating control points</h4>

<p>Points can be manipulated in one of four <dfn>edit modes</dfn>.
The current edit mode is selected using the buttons at the top
right. The available modes are <em class="mode">move points</em>, <em
class="mode">add points</em>, <em class="mode">delete
points</em>, and <em class="mode">set coordinates</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em class="mode">add points</em> mode, click anywhere to add a
new point. The point will be inserted into the closest segment of the
control polygon.</li>

<li>In <em class="mode">delete points</em> mode, click on a point to
delete it. You cannot delete a point if doing so would reduce the
number of points below four; a point of multiplicity two counts as two
points, and a point of multiplicity three counts as three
points. </li>

<li>In <em class="mode">move points</em> mode, you can drag a control
point to a new position. In this mode, you can also change a point's
multiplicity by double clicking it. Points with multiplicity one are
white, green indicates a multiplicity of two, and red indicates a
multiplicity of three. You cannot lower a point's multiplicity if
doing so would reduce the number of points below four; see the
previous point.</li>

<li>Finally, in <em class="mode">set coordinates</em> mode, clicking
on a control point lets you explicitly set its X and Y coordinates.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Manipulating the view</h4> 

<ul>
<li>To pan the view, drag in the view window while holding Shift.</li>

<li>To zoom in or out, drag in the view window while holding Ctrl, or
drag while pressing the middle mouse button. Dragging up zooms in,
while dragging down zooms out.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can toggle the display of the control points, the control
polygon, the edited curve, the coordinate system axes, the grid and
the labels on the grid using buttons grouped in the <em
class="button">Display</em> section.</p>


<hr>
<h2>
<a name="functions"></a>
Functions</h2> 

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/function_editor.png"
     alt="Function editor">
</div>

<p>The function editor is very similar to the contour editor. The
objects being edited are also cubic spline contours, but have some
additional constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>The X-coordinate of the first point is equal to 0 (zero);</li>
<li>The X-coordinate of the last point is equal to 1; and</li>
<li>For any two consecutive points p<sub>i</sub> and
p<sub>i+1</sub> on the curve,
X<sub>pi</sub>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;X<sub>pi+1</sub>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These conditions assure that the curve can be interpreted as a
function of X.</p>

<h4>Manipulating control points</h4>

<p>Points can be manipulated in one of four <dfn>edit modes</dfn>.
The current edit mode is selected using the buttons at the top
right. The available modes are <em class="mode">move points</em>, <em
class="mode">add points</em>, <em class="mode">delete
points</em>, and <em class="mode">set coordinates</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em class="mode">add points</em> mode, click anywhere to add a
new point. The point will be inserted into the closest segment of the
control polygon.</li>

<li>In <em class="mode">delete points</em> mode, click on a point to
delete it. You cannot delete a point if doing so would reduce the
number of points below four.</li>

<li><p>In <em class="mode">move points</em> mode, you can drag a
control point to a new position. The X coordinate of the point will
always be held between the X coordinates of its neighbours.</li>

<li><p>Finally, in <em class="mode">set coordinates</em> mode, clicking
on a control point lets you explicitly set its X and Y coordinates.
The Y coordinate can be set to any value, but the X coordinate must
be between the X coordinates of the neighbouring points.</p>
<img src="images/fn_setpoint.png"
     alt="Set point dialog">
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Manipulating the view</h4> 

<ul>
<li>To pan the view, drag in the view window while holding Shift.</li>

<li>To zoom in or out, drag in the view window while holding Ctrl, or
drag while pressing the middle mouse button. Dragging up zooms in,
while dragging down zooms out.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can toggle the display of the control points, the control
polygon, the edited function, the coordinate system axes, the grid and
the labels on the grid using buttons grouped in the <em
class="button">Display</em> section.</p>


<h4>Flip view</h4>

<p>The functions can be displayed in two ways. Traditionally, the
domain (X) of the function y=f(x) is associated with the horizontal
axis, while the range (Y) is associated with the vertical axis.  In
some cases, it is convenient to assume that X is the vertical axis and
Y is the horizontal axis. To do this you can check the <em
class="button">Flip view</em> check box. Flip view is a
property of a function, so it is possible to have only some of
the functions flipped. This property is saved together with a function
only if the gallery of functions is bound into a function set.</p>

<h4>Samples</h4>

<p>This is the number of samples to be precomputed by
<i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i> for a function. For more information, refer to
the section <cite>Function galleries</cite> in <a
href="CPFGwhatsnew.pdf">What's new in <i>cpfg</i></a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="panels"></a>
Panels</h2>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/paneleditor.png"
     alt="Panel editor">
</div>

<p>Panels are used to control parameters during experiments. An
extensive description of panels can be found in <a href=
"http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Research/bmv/vlab/panel.html">
the <i>vlab</i> panels documentation</a>.
The description provided here focuses on the user's perspective of the
panels editor, as well as on the differences between <i>vlab</i> and
L-studio implementations.</p>

<h4><a name="panelworkingmode"></a>
Working mode</h4>

<p>The current working mode is determined by the buttons <em
class="button">Execute</em> and <em class="button">Design</em>.  In
<em class="mode">Execute</em> mode, the user can interactively change
the displayed values; these changes are immediately applied to the
relevant files on the lab table. In <em class="mode">Design</em> mode,
the panels themselves can be modified, and the commands along the
right side of the editor are accessible.</p>
