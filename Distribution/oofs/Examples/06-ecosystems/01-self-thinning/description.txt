An individual-based model of self-thinning

This is a simplified version of the model of self-thinning
proposed by Firbank and Watkinson in "A model of interference
within plant monocultures", Journal of Theoretical Biology
116 (1985), pp. 291-311.  A closely related open-L-system 
implementation is described in "Realistic modeling and
rendering of plant ecosystems" by O. Deussen, P. Hanrahan, 
B. Lintermann, R. Mech, M. Pharr, and P. Prusinkiewicz,
Proceedings of Siggraph '98, pp. 275 - 286.  

The simulation starts with an initial set of plants (represented 
by green circles), distributed at random in a square field, and 
assigned random initial radii.  If the circles representing two 
plants intersect, the smallercircle changes to red to indicate 
that the plant is dominated.  In the next simulation
step the red circle disappears, to indicate that the plant 
has died.  Plants that have reached a predefined limit size 
are represented by yellow circles and no longer increase
in diameter.
