A model of compact phyllotactic patterns based on 
Ridley's approximation.

The shape of the supporting surface is controlled by editing the 
generating contour (contour > receptacle shape on the menu), 
and the distribution of spherical organ primordia can be edited
using function > primordium size. 


This is a direct implementation of Algorithm 5 from
P. Prusinkiewicz, L. Muendermann, R. Karwowski and 
B. Lane, "The use of positional information in the 
modeling of plants", Proceedings of Siggraph 2001.
Have a look at the L-system (available through the
menu item "L-system").
