COMPOUND LEAF (USING A HOMOMORPHISM)

Example of a very simple L-system generating a compound
branching structure.  Ordinary L-system productions
use intuitive symbols (A for apex, I for internode).
The graphical interpretation of these symbols is 
specified using homomorphic rules (after the keyword
'homomorphism').
