A symmetric compound leaf

This is a demo object illustrating the use of functions that can be
specified graphically.  The functions are expressed in terms of the
relative distance travelled along the main axis (arc length),
measured from the leaf base.  They control:

- the branching angle at which the leaflets are inserted
- stem curvature
- internode length
- internode width
- leaf length
- leaf width

The leaf length function specifies (approximately, i.e., disregarding
the branching angles) the overall contour of the leaf.  The 
position of individual leaflets is calculated using the internode 
length function, which can be viewed as defining the density of 
leaflet distribution along the axis.  Thus, the length and position
of leaflets are calculated from more global leaf characteristics.  
This reverses the usual process of modeling using L-systems, where 
the leaf countour and the distribution of leaflets are emergent 
properties of the developmental model.
