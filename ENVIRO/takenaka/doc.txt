Name of the executable: takenaka

Necessary command line parameters: 
   takenaka [-k semaphore_key] [-ext comm_files_extension] 
	    -e environment_file specification_file


Commands in specification file:

 grid size: x y z (numbers can be delimited also by , ; or x)
			 size of the grid in voxels (the range in world 
		         coordinates is determined according to the queries so
			 it tightly encloses them)

 verbose: on/off         switches on or off verbose mode

 parameter s: float (default 1.5)
			 sparsity of leaf distribution on the leaf ball.
			 If r is the radius of a sphere with surface area 
			 equal to the leaf area LA, then the radius of the 
			 leaf ball is (s.r).
			 
 transmittance: t (float)  (default 0.1)
			 transmittance of the leaf balls (0.0-1.0). 

 efficiency: float (default 0.015)
			 see the paper, but basiccaly multiplicative parameter
			 influencing the resulting light product.

 source: x y z intensity
			 defines a ligth source with a specific intensity.
			 After all sources are defined their intensities are
			 normalized so that their sum is 1.


 beam radius: rad        radius of a ray when tested for a leaf ball 
			 intersection expressed as a part of the current
			 leaf ball radius (0-1). Default 0.

Communication:
 Turtle parameters sent to the field: position.
 Communication symbol:
  - 2 parameters
     to field: 
        1) leaf area
	2) weight of product necessary for the leaf maintenance

     from field:
        1) leaf area stays there
        2) product of photosynthesis (after the maintenance cost is subtracted)


Algorithm:
  Program stores all incoming queries in a dynamically allocated array.
After that a grid is build to speed up ray casting.

  At the end, it determines the amount of incoming light for each query.
The amount of light is computed by shooting rays from the leaf ball centre to
each light source. Each intersected leaf reduces the perceived light intensity.
The weight of the final product is computed according to the appendix of the
paper.
