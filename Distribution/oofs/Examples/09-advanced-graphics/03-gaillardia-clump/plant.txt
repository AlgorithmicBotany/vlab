A preliminary model of Indian Blanket - Gaillardia pulchella (Asteraceae)

According to a photograph in the Canadian Wildflowers 1997 Calendar

The model features three-patch petals with textures.  
The shape of the petals can be modified using ISE.  
Material properties can be manipulated using medit.
The textures can be modified using xpaint.
Their layout can be changed using warp.

TO DO:

The flower base (with sepals?) and the stem are obviously missing.

The central part of the real flower looks somewhat diferently; in particular
it has a "bald area" in the center.  The L-system is ready for this, but 
proper surfaces (called "seed" and "rayfloret" because of the model's 
history) should be created.

The L-system has reasonable parameters for manipulating the shape
of the flower head, the angle of insertion of the petals, numbers of
organs, etc.  It would be nice to create a corresponding control panel.
(Color map is maintained for this purpose, otherwise it is not needed).

It would be interesting to create the petal texture algorithmically
for example, using an L-system implementation of the cellular automaton
model by Young (check).

The warp program does not place the texture in the same manner as
it is placed by cpfg (also, it must be restarted after each Save operation,
because it bombs during the second one).
