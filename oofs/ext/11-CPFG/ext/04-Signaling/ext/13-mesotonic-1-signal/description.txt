A model of the development of a mesotonic structure, 
controlled by an acropetal signal.  

A detailed description of this model is presented
in the paper "Visual Models of Plant Development" by 
P. Prusinkiewicz, M. Hammel, J. Hanan, and R. Mech, 
published in G. Rozenberg and A. Salomaa (Eds.): 
Handbook of Formal Languages Vol III, 
Springer, Berlin 1997, pp. 535-597.
