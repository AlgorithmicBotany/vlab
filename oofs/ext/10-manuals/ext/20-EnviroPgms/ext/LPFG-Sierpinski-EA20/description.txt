Open L-system implementation of the Sierpinski gasket

This  is a simple example of a model that interacts with
an environmental program, 'honda81', using the EA20 array.

The axiom initiates two branches, terminated by apices A
and B.  The apex type controls the branching direction
(to the left or to the right). An apex is decomposed 
into two "tentacles", tentA and tentB, each terminated by 
communication module E1(VIGOR).  The environment (handled 
by process honda81) returns value 1 (grow) if there is no 
collision, and 0 (don't grow)if there is a collision.  
A tentacle that does not collide is replaced by a permanent 
line with an apex A or B, which issues new tentacles.  
A tentacle that has collided is displayed as a gray line 
and does not produce an apex.

Note: This is a direct translation of the cpfg model 
to lpfg.
