FRACTAL FERN LEAVES - CONTINUOUS-TIME DEVELOPMENT

A simple parametric L-system generating a family of 
compound branching structures that resemble fern leaves.
This model operates in continuous time, with the time 
increment dt.  The model is expressed using productions 
with local variables and statement blocks.
