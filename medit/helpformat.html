<p><b>>&nbsp; medit</b>
<br>Open an empty gallery for up to 256 materials.
<p><b>>&nbsp; medit [file.mat] ...</b>
<br>Opens the specified material file(s).
<br>If the file does not exist, creates new file.
<br>If a list of material files is specified, each is open in a separate
application window.
<p><b>>&nbsp; medit ... -w [width] [height]</b>

<br><i></i>&nbsp;
<h2>
<i>2 Display and Selection</i></h2>

<ul>
<li>
When the program starts, 16 of the 256 spheres are displayed, beginning
on the first page. Index 0 is in the upper left corner, with consecutive
entries vertically, top to bottom.&nbsp; To display more or less spheres
per page, select <b><i>Display</i></b> from the <b>menu bar </b>at the
top of the window, then select the desired <b>page size</b> (1, 4x4, 8x8,
16x16).</li>

<li>
A <b>material index may be selected </b>by clicking the <b>left mouse</b>
button on the entry, or by entering the index in the first spinbox in the
lower right corner.</li>

<li>
A <b>range of indices</b> can be selected by clicking the left mouse on
the lesser index, and dragging to the greater index.&nbsp; A range can
also be selected by selecting <b><i>Edit</i></b> from the menu bar, and
then selecting <b><i>Select Range...</i></b>, which opens a dialog box
to input the start index and end index or number selected.</li>

<li>
All materials on the current page, or all materials in the gallery, can
be selected by selecting <b><i>Edit </i></b>from the menu bar, then <b><i>Select
All in Page</i></b> or <b><i>Select All in Gallery</i></b>.</li>

spinbox in the lower right corner, or by selecting <b><i>Display</i></b>
from the menu bar and then selecting <b><i>Next Page, Previous Page</i></b>
or <b><i>First Page</i></b>.&nbsp; The number of pages, as well as the
page a particular material falls on, depends on the page size.&nbsp; The
indices materials that are displayed on the current page are shown in the
upper right corner of the window.&nbsp; When a page is changed, the current
selection is not affected.</li>

<li>
The background is black by default.&nbsp; To show transparency, it is useful
to <b>change the background to a checkerboard pattern</b>.&nbsp; To do

this option again.</li>

<li>
The spheres are rendered as a polygon mesh between vertices.&nbsp; The
rendering speed varies inversely to the smoothness of the spheres.&nbsp;
To <b>adjust the smoothness</b>, and to set the auto-adjustment of the
smoothness, select <b><i>Display</i></b> from the menu bar, then select
<b><i>Image Quality...</i></b> to edit the smoothenss parameters.&nbsp;
