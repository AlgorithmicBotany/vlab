L-system implementation of the spiral phyllotaxis model
based on Vogel's formmula.

The entire phyllotactic pattern is created at once, using
a decomposition rule.  Primordia C are replaced by disks
by a regular L-system rule (rather than a homomorphism).
This organization of the model makes it easy to implement
canalization resulting from collisions between primordia
(next example).
