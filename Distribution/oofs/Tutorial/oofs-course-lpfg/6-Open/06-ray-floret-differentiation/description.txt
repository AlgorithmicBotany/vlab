Differentiation of ray florets

The entire phyllotactic pattern is created at once, using
a decomposition rule.  Consecutive primordia are assigned 
increasing vigor values.  The environment compares vigors of
colliding primordia.  The primordium with a lower vigor
is dominated by the primordiumn of a higher vigor.  
The only primordia that are not dominated are situated
on the circumference of the capitulum.  These 
primordia form ray florets ("petals"), while the remaining
promirdia form disk florets
