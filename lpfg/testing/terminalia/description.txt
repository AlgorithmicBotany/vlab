A model of Terminalia catappa tiers, based on 
the paper "Computer simulation of branch interaction
and regulation by unequal flow rates in botanical trees"
by H. Honda, P.B. Tomlinson and J.B. Fisher, American
Journal of Botany 68 (1981), pp. 569-585.  Collisions
between leaf clusters (shown as circles) limit the
extent of branching.

This is a simple example of an open L-system in action.
A description of this L-system implementation is
included in the paper "Visual models of plants
interacting with their environment", by R. Mech and
P. Prusinkiewicz, Procedings of Siggraph 96, pp. 397-410.
