Shear Modulus (GPa)

THE KIWIFRUIT MODEL:
(NOTE: this is an emprical model, so we need to now final size and growth rate of organs)
(NOTE: the node number in the equations for growth does not include
        bud scales (nodes 1-4) and transitional leaves (nodes 5-7))

The timing of appearance between two leaves is the phyllochron.
The following equation defines this timing in days,
t_a(node) = {time_of_bud_break               node <= 7
            {time_of_bud_break + Ph(node-7)  n > 7
assuming the number of reproductive nodes is 7

The expansion of the area of an individual leaf is given by Boltzmann function
a(t,node) = (A(node)-B(node))exp[(t-t_o(node))/tau]/(1+exp[(t-t_o(node))/tau])+B.
  - A(node) is final leaf area.
  - B(node) is lower asymptote that depends on initial_size (asymptote can be negative, which represents preformed development).
  - tau is a constant that represents the duration of 'window' of rapid expansion.
  - t is time (days from budbreak)
  - t_o(node) is the timing of expansion ("timing of the maximum rate of expansion"),
    and is given by
    t_o(node) = time_of_bud_break + {9.3Ph + 1.36(n-7)      node <=7
                                    {9.3Ph + 2alphaPh(n-7)  7 < n <= 18
                                    {28Ph + alphaPh(n-18)   18 < n
assuming the number of preformed nodes is 18.
The final leaf area is determinded by a function that was
fit to data for shoots in a high temperature treatment, and is irrespective of shoot type.
The initial leaf area is constant at 2.5 cm^2.
'tau' is constant at 3.3 for leaves.
't_o(node)' is defined as above for leaves.

Shoot internode length expansion (primary growth) is determined by the Boltzmann function.
The final internode length is 10cm for long, medium, and 2 cm for short shoots.
  - the paper by Clearwater: short shoots with no internodes longer than 15mm
                             medium shoots with at least one internode longer than 15mm
                             long shoots ? just not self-terminated.
 
The initial internode length is zero for now.
'tau' is set to half of 'tau' for leaves (same as Alla's model).
't_o(node)' is defined as a constant as in Alla's model (though a linear function may be better?)

Shoot internode width (secondary growth) is based on some kind of allometric relationship and the pipe model.
The girth of an internode is a function of the number of leaves (or child branches) that it supports.

Single flower growth and expansion occurs over a 60 day period after budbreak.
I assumed the growth is linear over this peroid.
The final diameter is between 35-68 mm (I'm not sure if there is a positional effect).
The probability of flower abortion is based on its position along the shoot.
I determined this probability from a paper by Walton and Fowke (1993),
and defined a graphical function called prob_floral_abort.

Fruit growth and development occurs after anthesis, and lasts for approximately 180 days.
Usually the fruit is harvested after 150 days.
Fruit volume after anthesis is defined by a graphical function called fruit_volume.
It has the form of a double-sigmodial function.
I am not using growth rate here!


The initial structure consists of three axillary buds,
with the first producing a short shoot, the second a
medium shoot and the third a long shoot. 
The module "AxBud" is decomposed into the structures
that are preformed in the FOAB, and the apex at the last node.
Currently, the number of preformed structures is fixed!
The Apex module is responsible for creating new structures (neoformation).



QUESTIONS:
What do the second order axillary buds do?
  It turns out, they do not normally grow into shoots unless primary growth point (shoot tip/apex) is removed.

In Alla's leaf and internode growth equations, does the node number start
at the first leaf?
  I'm am pretty sure this is the case, and her equations start at node 8.
