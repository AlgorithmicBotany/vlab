Perspective projection

Cpfg also supports perspective viewing, although
it is more difficult to properly set parameter values.

The model can be saved in 'rayshade' format using the Save As.. menu item
on the cpfg menu, to create leaf.ray

The resulting file (leaf.ray) is raytraced from the object menu:

	raytrace > rayshade

This will create a PNG file, leaf.png, which can be viewed using:

	raytrace > display
