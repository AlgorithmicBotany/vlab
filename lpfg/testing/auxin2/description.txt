A canalization-based model of auxin trasport.

This model is based on the apical dominance model.

The implementation is based on Shapiro's chain/co-chain concept,
with both the concentrations of the substance in the cells, and 
the flux across the walls explicitly represented and visualized
in this model.

- A cell wall "sees" the concentrations of the diffusing substance
  in the neighboring cells, and on this basis decides what flux is
  going to go through it in the next time step.
- A cell "sees" the fluxes through the neighboring walls, and on this
  basis updates its morphogen concentration.
