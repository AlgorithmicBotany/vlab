A clump of Indian Blanket flowers (Gaillardia pulchella)

The phyllotactic arrangement on the flower heads has been modeled
using an adaptation of the sunflower model.  

The model illustrates the use of textures, which have been
placed on the petals (painted) and leaves (scanned from 
a leaf of another species and distorted).

Bugs - the florets on the flower head could be modeled more
precisely to allow for an extreme zoom in.
