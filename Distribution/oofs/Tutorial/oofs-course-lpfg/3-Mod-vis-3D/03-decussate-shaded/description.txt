3D model visualization

This is a simple example of 3D model visualization.  
See the view file for the parameters used, and explore 
the alternatives, as indicated there. 

This model operates in the material mode.  Material 
parameters can be specified using the material editor.  
Light parameters are listed in the view file.  Specifying
material and light parameters that result in appealing 
images is a true art.
