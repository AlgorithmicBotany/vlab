Open L-system implementation of the Sierpinski gasket

This is a simple example of a model that interacts with
an environment

The axiom initiates two branches, terminated by apices A.
The second branch is repositioned (rotated and reflected
with respect to the first one) by symbol r.  An apex is 
decomposed into two 'tentacles', f, each terminated by 
communication module ?E(VIGOR).  The environment (handled 
by process honda81) returns value 1 (grow) if there is no 
collision, and 0 (don't grow) if there is a collision.  
A tentacle that does not collide is replaced by a permanent 
line terminated by apex, which issues new tentacles.  
A tentacle that has collided is displayed as a gray line 
and does not produce an apex.

To see the values going to and coming from the environmental program,
look for the files .to_field* and .from_field* on the lab table.
