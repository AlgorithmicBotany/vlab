A simple illustration of information propagation in a ring L-system

The decomposition rules create a string of NR-1 segments B and one segment A. 
Due to the presence of the "ring lsystem" statement, the string has ring 
topology: the last string element is the left neighbor of the first element.  
Productions propagate symbol A in the direction dependent on parameter dir 
(0 or 1).  The homomorphism rules give the structure a circular geometry. 

The object includes control panels associated with the L-system and animation file.
