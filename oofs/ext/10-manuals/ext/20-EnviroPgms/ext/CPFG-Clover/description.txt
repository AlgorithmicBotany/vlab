A generic model of clover growing on a terrain with different 
intensity of incoming light (darker areas can be thought
of as being shadowed by the trees above). The model is 
described in detail in the paper "Visual models of plants 
interacting with their  environment", by R. Mech and 
P. Prusinkiewicz, Proceedings of Siggraph 96, pp. 397-410.

Above a light threshold the internodes are shorter and 
branching angles wider.

The environmental program 'clover' simulates the amount of direct light
coming from the top, based on the input image 'light.rgb'.  
A high-resolution version of the same image, 'light08.rgb' is used as a
background in the model (see the 'texture:' in the viewfile 'plant.v'.
