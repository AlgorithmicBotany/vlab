A stylized model of a lily

The model illustrates the use of generalized cylinders, which 
have been employed to create all surfaces.  Their profile can be
changed using the contour editor.  Also, the model illustrates
the use of separate colors at both sides of the petals.

Note: The random number generator is invoked each time when the
plant is rotated, causing slight changes in its shape.
