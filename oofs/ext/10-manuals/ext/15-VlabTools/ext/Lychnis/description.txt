Lychnis coronaria - Rose campion

A developmental model originally based on the L-system on page 84
of the "Algorithmic Beauty of Plants".

This example began as an illustration of a simple 
developmental model expressed using a context-free 
L-system (no information flow between the modules). 
It now includes:
- functions
- contours
- surfaces
- a timeline
