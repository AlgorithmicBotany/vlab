Insect attack

The insect foraging on the plant is represented 
by a signal and moved around using context-sensitive 
rules.  The insect eats buds; when all buds on a branch
are eaten, the branch dies.  A detailed description 
of this model is presented in the paper "Visual Models 
of Plant Development" by P. Prusinkiewicz, M. Hammel, 
J. Hanan, and R. Mech, published in G. Rozenberg 
and A. Salomaa (Eds.): Handbook of Formal Languages 
Vol III, Springer, Berlin 1997, pp. 535-597.
