This is a demo object illustrating the use of functions that can be
specified graphically.  In contrast to the "symmetric compound leaf",
also provided as an example, in this case the leaves are arranged in
a spiral phyllotactic pattern.

The model makes use of three families of functions.  

The first family consists of functions expressed in terms of the 
relative distance travelled along the main axis (arc length), 
measured from the leaf base.   These functions control:
- plant diameter at a given height (i.e. the length of the leaflets)
- leaf density distribution (i.e. the length of the internodes)
- local curving of the stem (3 functions)
- stem width
- branching angle at which the leaves are inserted
- overall leaf width
- leaflet color

The second family consists of functions expressed in terms of the 
relative distance travelled along the axis (midrib) of the leaves.  
These functions control:
- leaf width (at a given position along the midrib)
- density of "veins" that branch off the midrib to define leaflet shape
- local curvature of the leaflet (2 functions).

The third family consists of just one function, which determines how
the distribution of leaves along the main axis scales with the overall
changes of the stem length.

The partition of functions into three families is evident in the vlab
implementation of this model, but lost in L-studio, where all functions
are listed alphabetically.
