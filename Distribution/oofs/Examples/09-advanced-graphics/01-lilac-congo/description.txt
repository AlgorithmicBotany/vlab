Syringa vulgaris Congo - modeled with arrays
This is joint work with Campbell Davidson, based on
measurements of a real lilac inflorescence made
on May 29, 1993 at the Agriculture/Agrifood Canada
Research Station in Morden, Manitoba.

The internode lengths are read from a file to two arrays, 
corresponding to the main axis and first-order branches.

This model shows how to read measured data from a file 
to an L-system model.  It also gives an example of using 
arrays.
