A generic model of clover growing on a terrain with different 
intensity of incoming light (darker areas can be thought
of as being shadowed by the trees above). The model is 
described in detail the paper "Visual models of plants 
interacting with their  environment", by R. Mech and 
P. Prusinkiewicz, Proceedings of Siggraph 96, pp. 397-410.
