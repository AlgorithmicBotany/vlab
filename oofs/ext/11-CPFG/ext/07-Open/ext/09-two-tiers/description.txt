Two branch tiers competing for space.

Based on a model by H. Honda, P. Tomlinson, and J. B. Fisher,
"Computer simulation of branch interaction and regulation 
by unequal flow rates in botanical trees". American Journal 
of Botany 68 (1981), 569â€“585.

The L-system implementation is described in the paper "Visual 
models of plants interacting with their environment", by R. Mech 
and P. Prusinkiewicz, Proceedings of Siggraph 96, pp. 397-410.
