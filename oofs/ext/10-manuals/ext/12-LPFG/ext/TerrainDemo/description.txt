Terrain demo

On the lpfg menu, select Forever. You will notice that the terrain shape
acquires more detail as you zoom in.

Functionality related to terrain is kept to provide backward compatibility
with some models that used it, in particular models of plants in the 
Rhynie chert.

Some functions needed to interface with this code (e.g., to put plants 
on it) are in the Deprecated section of the lpfg manual. Unfortunately,
no further documentation (including .patch file format) is available,
and the terrain editor no longer works. However, different files used
by this editor are kept in the object, in case the editor is revived
in the future.

No further documentation is available at this  point (Oct. 2, 2021).
