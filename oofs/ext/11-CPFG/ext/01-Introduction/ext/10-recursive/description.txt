FRACTAL FERN LEAF - RECURSIVE DECOMPOSITION

At a limit, the entire structure at a certain time can 
be obtained by recursive application of decomposition 
rules and/or interpretation rules.  This constitutes 
a link between  developmental and structural models.  
This example illustrates recursive application 
of the interpretation rules.

Models can be constructed this way only if no
context-sensitive productions are used.
