Foraging insect

Insect performs depth-first search of a growing sympodial
branching structure.  It eats apices, which terminates
the growth of a given branch.

- information about where the insect came from, and where it is going,
  is entirely represented by the insect's state (U,V,D), without leaving
  "pheromone"-like information (L,R) at the nodes.
- homomorphisms are used to dissociate the logial state of the insect
  (U,V,D) from the visual representation of the insect.
