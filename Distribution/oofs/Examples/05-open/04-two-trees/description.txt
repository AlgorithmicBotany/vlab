Two decidious trees with branches competing for light.
Based on the paper "A simulation model of tree architecture
development based on growth response to local light environment"
by A. Takenaka, Journal of Plant Research 107 (1994), pp. 321-330.
The L-system implementation is described in the paper "Visual 
models of plants interacting with their environment", by R. Mech 
and P. Prusinkiewicz, Procedings of Siggraph 96, pp. 397-410.

This model is too complicated to provide a useful starting 
example of the construction of a plant model interacting 
with its environment, but it was used to demonstrate the correctness
of the port of the original UNIX version of cpfg and the environmental 
program to the Windows environment.
