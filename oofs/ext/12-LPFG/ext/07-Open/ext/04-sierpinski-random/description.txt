Modification of the Sierpinski gasket

This  is a simple example of a model that interacts with
an environment, based on the Sierpinski gasket construction.
The modification consists of assigning random values to the
tentacles.  When two tentacles collide, the one with a higher
vigor wins, giving rise to a branch.

Specifically, the axiom initiates two branches, terminated by 
apices A and B.  The apex type controls the branching direction
(to the left or to the right). An apex is decomposed 
into two "tentacles", tentA and tentB, each terminated by 
communication module E1(VIGOR).  The VIGOR values are 
assigned at random.  When a collision occurs, the environment 
(handled by process honda81) returns value 1 (grow) to the more 
vigorous tentacle, and 0 (don't grow) to the less vigorous one.  
A tentacle that is allowed to grow is replaced by a permanent 
line with an apex A or B, which issues new tentacles.
