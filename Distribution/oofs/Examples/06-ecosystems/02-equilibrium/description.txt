Emergence of the hierarchy of sizes

This L-system is a variant of the model of self-thinning.
The key new feature is that new small plants are added to
the field in each step.  Most of them are dominated by 
older plants and quickly die off, only to be replaced by
new small plants, but some reach a large size.  Over time,
a relatively stable equilibrium distribution emerges
(the "hierarchy of sizes"), in which there are many small 
plants and few large plants.  The formation of this 
distribution is illustrated by an x-y plot, in which
x is a size class, and y is the number of plants in this 
class.
