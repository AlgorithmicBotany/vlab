Monopodial structure with spiral phyllotaxis

The model illustrates the used of bicubic surfaces scaled
separately in different directions, and the use of 
textures with transparency to model leaves with complex shapes.

This model also uses graphically defined functions of time
to control:
- the elongation of internodes,
- the growth of leaves in length and width,
- the branching angles between the stem and the leaves, and
- the gradual changes of leaf colors.

Slight orthotropism improves the appearance of the model.
