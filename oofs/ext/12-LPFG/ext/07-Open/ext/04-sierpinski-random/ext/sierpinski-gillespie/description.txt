Yet another modification of the Sierpinski gasket

by Mik Cieslak, Feb. 23, 2006

This is a simple example of a model that interacts with
an environment, based on the Sierpinski gasket construction.
The modification consists of randomly choosing which of the
tentacles to grow.  The final result is a Sierpinsk gasket
which looks like the one that is generated by assigning
each tentacle a random VIGOR.

Specifically, the axiom initiates two branches, terminated by 
apices A and B.  The apex type controls the branching direction
(to the left or to the right).  An apex is randomly decomposed 
into one of two "tentacles", tentA or tentB, each terminated by 
communication module E1(VIGOR).  The VIGOR values are 
assigned the same value for each tentacle. 
The environment (handled by process honda81) returns value 1 (grow)
or value 0 (don't grow) to the tentacle depending on if a collison
will occur.  
A tentacle that is allowed to grow is replaced by a permanent 
line with both an A apex and B apex at the end.


Problem 
The simulation takes a long time to complete for such a simple model.
The reason may be that all of the collision points are saved by the
model, which results in the environmental program having to compute
many collisions.  The solution may be to somehow disgard the collision
points once they are not needed.

Uses: environmental programs, honda81, Gillespie groups, SeedGillespie.
