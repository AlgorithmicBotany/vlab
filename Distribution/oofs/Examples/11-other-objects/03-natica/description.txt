Natica enzona

Note: The image appears as a result of "animating" the model.

Pigmentation pattern of the shell Natica enzona created using 
an activator-substrate reaction-diffusion model with the activator
decay, substrate production, and coefficient of proportionality
modulated using a sinusoidal function.  See H. Meinhardt and 
M. Klinger, "A model for pattern formation on the shells of
molluscs", Journal of Theoretical Biology 126 (1987), pp. 63-89,
Figure 12.

This example illustrates the possibility of using L-systems to
generate reaction-diffusion patterns and, more generally, to 
numerically solve partial differential equations (in this case,
using the forward Euler method).  For more information about
these applications of L-systems see M. Hammel and P. Prusinkiewicz,
"Visualization of developmental processes by extrusion in 
space-time", Proceedings of Graphics Interface 1996, pp. 246-258.
