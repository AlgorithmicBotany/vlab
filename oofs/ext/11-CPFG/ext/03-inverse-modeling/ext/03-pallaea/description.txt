An inverse model of Pellaea falcata

This model uses ideas similar to the 'fern-leaf'.  The objective
was to construct a model visually similar to a photograph of 
a Pellaea falcata leaf.  This objective was met, but the model
probably could be simplified.

Based on P. Prusinkiewicz, L. Muendermann, R. Karwowski and 
B. Lane, "The use of positional information in the 
modeling of plants", Proceedings of Siggraph 2001.
