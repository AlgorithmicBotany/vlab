A simple monopodial structure showing the increase of 
branch width as postulated by the pipe model.  

The information about the pipes coming from above 
is carried by basipetal signals (which in this case 
carry quantitative information).

It is assumed that each stem segment uses some 
photosynthates produced by the leaves.  The colors 
of the stem indicate the surplus (or deficit) of 
photosynthates at a given level.
