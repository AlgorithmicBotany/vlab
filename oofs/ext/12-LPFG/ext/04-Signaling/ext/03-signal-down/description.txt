Context-sensitivity - basipetal signal flow (down)

An basipetal signal flow is captured by a right-context-sensitive
production, complemented by a context-free production that
erases the existing signal after one step.  This mode of 
signal propagation critically relies on the synchronous operation
of L-systems.
