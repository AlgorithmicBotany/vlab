Basitonic flowering sequence

Florigen flows in a growing structure.  The vegetative 
apex is transformed into a flowering bud when the apex is
reached by florigen.  At this time, the apex induces
a second signal that propagates downwards and gradually 
enables the lateral branches to grow by lifting apical 
dominance.  The lateral buds transform themselves into
flowers after they have produced a predefined number of
lateral branch segments.

The florigen and the auxin-related signal are represented
by two parameters (f and a) associated with the internodes.
