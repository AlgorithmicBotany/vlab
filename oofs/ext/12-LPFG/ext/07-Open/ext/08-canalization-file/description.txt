Canalization of the number of organs in spiral phyllotaxis
(+ how to output simulation results to a file)

The model creates a sequence of flowerheads with an increasing
number of organs, and outputs the number of ray florets ("petals")
to the file output.txt for a subsequent analysis.  This file
can be viewed using the "Text file" tab. Observe that the numbers
of ray florets usually are Fibonacci numbers.

For each number of organs, the entire phyllotactic pattern 
is created at once, using a decomposition rule. 
Consecutive primordia are assigned increasing vigor values.  
The environment compares vigors of colliding primordia.  The
primordium with a lower vigor is dominated by the primordium 
of a higher vigor.  The only primordia that are not dominated 
are situated on the circumference of the capitulum (disk). These 
primordia form ray florets ("petals"), while the remaining
primordia form disk florets.
