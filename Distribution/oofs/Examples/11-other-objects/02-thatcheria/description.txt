An L-system model of a the Thatcheria mirabilis shell,
implemented as a generalized cylinder.  The original
version of this model (expressed without L-systems)
was described by D.R. Fowler, H. Meinhardt and 
P. Prusinkiewicz in "Modeling seashells", 
Proceedings of Siggraph 92, pp. 379-387.

The shape of the opening is defined as a contour and
can be interactively changed.
