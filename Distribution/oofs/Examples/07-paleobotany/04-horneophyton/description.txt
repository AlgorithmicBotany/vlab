A model of Horneopython ligneri

As shown in Stewart and Rothwell, Paleobotany and 
evolution of plants, p. 92, Fig 9.6.

Greenish-yellow color inspired by the reconstructions 
of Cooksonia and Zosterophyllum in White, 
Greening of Gondwana, pp. 64-65.

The whole plant also has rhizoids, not shown in this model.

This model illustrates the use of:
- materials
- generalized cylinders
- directional information
