An L-system implementation of the Tabebuia branch 
from Borchert and Honda, 1984. The red signal flowing up 
represents growth flux, with flow to sibling branches 
determined by an asymetric branching pattern and 
the relative number of terminals supported by each 
branch. The blue signal flowing down accumulates and 
records the number of terminals supported by each branch.
Bifurcation at a terminal depends on whether there is 
"enough" flux. Growth flux increases over time using a 
formula (sigmoidal) from the paper. If a given terminal 
doesn't branch for a certain number of steps it dies,
turning brown.  Note that each generation takes 2 steps 
more than the previous.

The width of branches is determined using the pipe model.

The first version of this model was implementd by 
Jim Hanan.

A detailed description of this L-system is presented
in the paper "Visual Models of Plant Development" by 
P. Prusinkiewicz, M. Hammel, J. Hanan, and R. Mech, 
published in G. Rozenberg and A. Salomaa (Eds.): 
Handbook of Formal Languages Vol III, 
Springer, Berlin 1997, pp. 535-597.

Bugs:  This model adds at most one level of branches per
generation, even when the flux reaching an apex is large.
Decomposition rules could be used to allow for multi-segment
axes to be added in single steps.
