Kinematic model of a jumping articulated lamp inspired by "Luxo Junior"

The model provides a simple example of the application of 
graphically defined functions to control an animation. 
The L-system is similar to that of the static ArticulatedLamp
object; the main difference is that angles are controlled 
by functions of time rather than a control panel. 

Moreover, two of the joint angles are controlled by differences 
of the angle values returned by the functions, rather than these
functions directly. This makes the lamp's posture easier 
to manipulate, as changes in the argument values now preserve 
the orientation of the lamp head, as would be the case in a real
articulated lamp.
