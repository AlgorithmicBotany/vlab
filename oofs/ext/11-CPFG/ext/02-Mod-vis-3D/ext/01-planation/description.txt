Planation - monopodial branching

This animation illustrates the relation between a 3D 
branching structure and a 2D structure obtained by 
changing the divergence angle.  A transition from
3D to 2D, or planation, is one of evolutionary 
modifications predicted by Zimmermann's telome theory
of plant evolution (cf. W. N. Stewart and G. W. 
Rothwell, "Paleobotany and the evolution on plants 
(second edition)", Cambridge University Press, 1993).
Here this transition is illustrated using monopodial
branching, showing the relation between opposite and
opposite-decussate branching patterns.

Select 'Animate' and then 'Run' from the menu
to see the structure grow and then change from 2D to 3D and back again.
