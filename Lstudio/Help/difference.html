<h1>Differences between L-studio&nbsp;(Windows)
and <i>vlab</i>&nbsp;(UNIX)</h1>

<p>If you are already familiar with the UNIX version of <i>vlab</i>
and <i>cpfg</i> and/or you are planning to exchange objects between
the two platforms, you should read this section.</p>

<h4>Limitations of L-studio:</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>vlab</i>'s prototype-extension paradigm is not implemented.
Objects are completely independent: files are always stored as
copies, never as links.</li>
<li>Colormap mode is limited to 256 entries, not 4K entries as in the
<i>vlab</i> version.</li>
<li>The communication library supports only communication using
files.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Differences to be aware of</h4> 

<ul>
<li><p>When transferring files between Windows and UNIX machines you
should pay attention to the transfer mode. All text files (especially
<tt>*.l</tt>, <tt>*.v</tt>, <tt>*.a</tt>, <tt>*.s</tt>,
<tt>*.con</tt>, <tt>*.e</tt>, <tt>*.func</tt>) should be transferred
in ASCII mode, due to CR/LF incompatibility between the two
platforms. Binary files (<tt>*.map</tt>, <tt>*.mat</tt>, images)
should be transferred in BINARY mode. Most FTP client programs support
CR/LF conversion. Some tools (like <a
href="http://www.ipswitch.com/">WS FTP</a>) let the user associate
file types with transfer mode.</p>

<p>If you transfer objects with the <a href="browser.html">object
browser</a>, the CR/LF conversions will be performed automatically.</p></li>

<li>Under <i>vlab</i>, files are associated with tools through the
<tt>specifications</tt> file. In L-studio, file types are determined
by their extensions. This may cause confusion if you don't use file
extensions consistently.</li>

<li>When an object is loaded into L-studio, files that are named
<tt>panel.l</tt>, <tt>panel.v</tt>, <tt>panel.a</tt>, or
<tt>panel.map</tt> are not imported.</li>

<li>An animation file (<tt>*.a</tt>) is always created by L-studio even if
there is no animation file in the object.</li>

<li>All text messages generated by <i>cpfg</i> are displayed in the
<i>Message Log</i> window (right below the main <i>cpfg</i>
window). Additionally, the text output (if any) is stored in a text
file called <tt>cpfg.log</tt>, located on the lab table. You can refer
to this file if <i>cpfg</i> exits as a result of a critical error and
its output window disappears before you have a chance to read the
error message.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="LSspecifications"></a>
The <tt>LSspecifications</tt> file</h4>

<p>If a file named <tt>LSspecifications</tt> is present in an object,
it is read by L-studio when the object is loaded. It will additionally
be reread if if is edited with the General text editor.
<tt>LSspecifications</tt> can contain the following sections:</p>

<table border="1"
       summary="Description of parameters found in the LSspecifications file">
<tr>
<th>Section</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Comment</td>
<td>A line is considered to be a comment if its first non-blank
character is a semicolon ';'.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ignore</td>
<td>An Ignore section starts with the line containing
'<tt>ignore:</tt>' and ends with a line containing a star
'<tt>*</tt>'. Lines contained between these two are treated as file
names. These files are not considered to be a part of the object, and
are ignored when the object is saved or when it is compared with the
original version to determine whether the it has changed. The
Ignore section is useful if a model produces files when it is
executed, and the files don't need to be saved as they can be easily
reproduced.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>cpfg</td>
<td>A line starting with the word <tt>cpfg</tt> is used as command
executed when the <em class="menu">Go!</em> command is selected from
the <em class="menu">Cpfg</em> menu.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Continuous mode</td>
<td><tt>continuous mode:</tt> must be followed by <tt>on</tt> or
<tt>off</tt>. It determines whether the <a href=
"invoke.html#continuous">continuous modeling mode</a> should be
turned on after the object has been loaded.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Active tab</td>
<td><tt>active tab</tt>: must be followed by one of the following:
<tt>lsystem</tt>, <tt>view</tt>, <tt>anim</tt>, <tt>colors</tt>,
<tt>surface</tt>, <tt>contour</tt>, <tt>function</tt>,
<tt>panels</tt>, <tt>description</tt>, <tt>anytext</tt>. It
determines which L-studio tab is active when the object is
loaded.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Auto run</td>
<td><tt>auto run:</tt> must be followed by <tt>on</tt> or
<tt>off</tt>. If it is <tt>on</tt>, <i>cpfg</i> will be started
as soon as the object is loaded into L-studio.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Auto exit</td>
<td>Auto run's counterpart is auto exit. The label <tt>auto exit:</tt>
must be followed by <tt>on</tt> or <tt>off</tt>. If it is <tt>on</tt>,
L-studio will exit as soon as you close <i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Demo mode</td>
<td><tt>demo mode:</tt> must be followed by <tt>on</tt> or
<tt>off</tt>. If it is <tt>on</tt>, then the object is opened in
"demo mode", which means that L-studio will not check if the object
has been modified when the user closes the object, and will not
prompt if the user wants to save changes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Auto tear-off</td>
<td><tt>panels auto tear off:</tt> must be followed by <tt>on</tt> or
<tt>off</tt>. If it is <tt>on</tt>, all of the object's panels are torn
off when it is loaded, just as if <em class="menu">Tear off all...</em>
had been chosen from the panel gallery menu.</td>
</tr>
