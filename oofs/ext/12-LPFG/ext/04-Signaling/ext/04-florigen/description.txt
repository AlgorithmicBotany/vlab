Flower induction by florigen

Florigen flows in a growing structure.  The vegetative 
apex is transformed into a flowering bud when the apex is
reached by florigen.

In this model, the presence of a signal in an internode is
represented by the internode type:
I - without a signal,
J - with a signal.
