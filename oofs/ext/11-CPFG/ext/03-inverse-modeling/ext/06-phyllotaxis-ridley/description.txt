A model of compact phyllotactic patterns based on 
Ridley's aproximation

You may control the shape of the supporting surface
by editing the generating curve (a contour) and change the distribution of
spherical organ primordia using the function.


This is a direct implementation of Algorithm 5 from
P. Prusinkiewicz, L. Muendermann, R. Karwowski and 
B. Lane, "The use of positional information in the 
modeling of plants", Proceedings of Siggraph 2001.
Have a look at the L-system (available through the
tab / menu item "L-system")!
