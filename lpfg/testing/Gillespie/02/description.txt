Decay and Diffusion of two substances between any number of cells using
stochastic simulation.  The pink substance (X) diffuses faster than the
green substance (Y) but both substances decay at the same rate.

The decay and diffusion process can be described in the following way.
- do-while number of molecules is greater than 0
  -- compute probability for diffusion of substance X and Y (dX,dY)
     in each cell and probability for decay (aX,aY)
  -- compute time of next reaction in each cell (not used in simulation)
  -- pick next reaction from cumulative probability (dX+dY+aX+aY) of all
     cells. This is done in two lpfg groups - 1.SEARCH and 2.NORMAL.
     1) Sum all of the probabilites (dX+dY+aX+aY) from each cell into "rateSum"
     2) Pick the "nextReaction" from the cumulative probability "rateSum"
  -- perform "nextReaction" but rescale "nextReaction" to be in the cell's
     cumulative probability (dX+dY+aX+aY) not in "rateSum".  If the rescaled
     "nextReaction" is in (dX+dY) perfrom a diffusion event otherwise perfrom
     a decay event.

The cell farthest to the right has a constant number of X and Y molecules,
but molecules can still diffuse to its neighbouring cell.  In the lpfg code
it is identified with a boolean flag "special".
