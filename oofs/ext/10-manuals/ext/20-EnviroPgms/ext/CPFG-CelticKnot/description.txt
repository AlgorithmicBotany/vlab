Celtic knot created by an environmental program checking for obstacles.

Here is how the files are used:

cpfg includes the environment file:  enviro.e
enviro.e defines the environmental program to be run:  obcheck
obcheck checks the current position of the turtle against obstacles.dat

cpfg displays the obstacles as a background scene, defined in viewfile.v:
     background scene: background.dat
background.dat is created from obstacles.dat using the mkbackground program

Steps to running the simulation
1.  Create the environmental program
	environment > enviro program > make
2.  Run the model:
	model > generate
3.  Select Animate, and then Run in the cpfg window
