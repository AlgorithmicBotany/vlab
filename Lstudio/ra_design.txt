Multi-user, synchronized, transactioned access

Interface on the level of objects, not files

interface independent from the method used for storing oofs (/ext considered 
irrelevant implementation detail on the level of interface)

Connection tied to the given database (currently some RA messages require 
oofs root as parameter, some don't. This may be related to the fact
that some commands update .dbase file e.g. RA_RENAME and some don't)
