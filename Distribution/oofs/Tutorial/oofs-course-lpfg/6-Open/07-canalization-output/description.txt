Canalization of the number of organs in spiral phyllotaxis

The model creates a sequence of flowerheads with an increasing
number of organs, and outputs the number of ray florets ("petals")
to the message window.  Observe that these numbers usually
are Fibonacci numbers.

For each number of organs, the entire phyllotactic pattern 
is created at once, using a decomposition rule. 
Consecutive primordia are assigned increasing vigor values.  
The environment compares vigors of colliding primordia.  The
primordium with a lower vigor is dominated by the primordiumn 
of a higher vigor.  The only primordia that are not dominated 
are situated on the circumference of the capitulum (disk). These 
primordia form ray florets ("petals"), while the remaining
promirdia form disk florets.
