Drawing with a mouse in lpfg

Then hold Key 1 (or Shift+Alt, Shift+Command, or all three),
and left click to draw.

The model illustrates the use of the MouseStatus structure,
defined as follows: 

struct MouseStatus
{
  int viewNum;                 // currently active view
  int viewX,viewY;             // x,y pixel positions of mouse cursor
			       
  V3d atFront,atRear,atMiddle; // intersection of cursor ray with
                               // front/back viewplane and
                               // halfway between them
			       // calculated when mouse status is called,
			       // independently of any keys

  bool lbDown;                 // left button currently down


  bool lbPushed, lbReleased;   // left button pressed or released
                               // since last call to GetMouseStatus
};
