A simple model of an ecosystem

The model communicates with the envirnment using the module ?E(r).

- parameter r send to the environment denotes current radius of the
  plant (conceptualized as a circle).  In addition, the communication
  symbols sends information about the position of the plant in the field.

- parameter r received from the environment is equal to 0 when the plant is
  dominated by another, greater than 0 otherwise.

The axiom defines a field with dimensions SIZE x SIZE and a 
set X of NR_INIT plants.  In the first simulation step no L-system
production is applied, and the decomposition rule
creates the actual plants P.

X(n) : n>0 {r = ran(R_INIT);} --> [f(ran(SIZE))-f(ran(SIZE))P(r)?E(r)]X(n-1)

According to this rule, each plant P is assigned a random initial radius r
from the interval (0, R_INIT), and is placed at a random position in the field.
The plant module P is followed by the communication module ?E which 
informs the environment about the position and radius of the plant.

Plants compete for space according to the rule that if the two circles 
representing neighboring plants intersect, the smaller plant dies and is 
removed from the scene.  A plant also dies if it has reached its maximum size
R_MAX.  These behaviors are captured by the L-system rule:

[f(y)-f(z)P(r)?E(x)] : x==0 || r >= R_MAX --> *

The plant that does not die grows: its radius increases by a random value 
in the range (0, R_INCR):

P(r)?E(x) : * {r = r + ran(R_INCR);} --> P(r)?E(r)

The remaining L-system rule:

X(n) : n==0 --> X(NR_INCR)

adds NR_INCR plants to the field in each step.

The plants are visualized using the homomorphism:

P(r) --> @c(2*r)
