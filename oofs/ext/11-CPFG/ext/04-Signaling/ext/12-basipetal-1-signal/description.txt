A model of flower initiation using a single acropetal
signal, based on L-system 3.1, page 77 of the
"Algorithmic beautry of plants."  A homomorphism defines
the appearance of all elements.  For these parameter
values, the flowering proceeds in a basipetal sequence.

Hint - Try the following:

		acropetal   basipetal

Plastochron 0	    2		2
Propagation 0	    1		0

Plastochron 1	    3		6
Propagation 1	    1		3
