<h1>Text editors</h1>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/texteditor.png"
     alt="The L-system editor"></div>

<p>Four of the L-studio tabs allow you to edit text files which are
part of the object. Three of these tabs are special-purpose, and edit
only one file: the <a href="#lsystem">L-system</a>, <a
href="#view">view file</a>, and <a href="#description">description</a>
tabs allow you to edit the L-system, view parameters file, and object
description, respectively. The <a href="#general">general text
editor</a> tab lets you edit any text file in the object.</p>

<p>The text editor used in L-studio is very simple; its editing
capabilities and user interface are similar to those of
Microsoft Notepad. Above the text area are some additional fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the file currently being edited.</li>
<li>The current <dfn>line number</dfn> &mdash; that is, the line the
cursor is on. You can enter a new number here to go to the beginning
of that line.</li>

<li>
<p>The <em class="widget">find box</em>. If you type in a word or
sequence of characters (a <dfn>search string</dfn>) here, then push
the <em class="button">Find</em> button next to it, or the Enter key
on your keyboard, the next instance of the search string after the
current cursor position will be highlighted. You can repeatedly press
Enter or the <em class="button">Find</em> button to go to each
successive instance of the search string; you can also use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F.  If the search string cannot be found
in the text file, you will be given the error "Pattern not found".</p>

<div class="largeimg">
<img src="images/finddlg.png"
     alt="Find dialog box">
</div>

<p>You can also search with the <em class="window">Find dialog
box</em>.  Pressing the <em class="widget">...</em> button next to the
<em class="widget">find</em> box will bring up this window. The Find
dialog box has an option to consider or disregard letter case; if the
<em class="button">Match case</em> option is switched off, lowercase
"a" will match uppercase "A" and vice versa; if it is on, lowercase
"a" will match only lowercase "a".</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a name="#lsystem"></a>
<a name="#view"></a>
<a name="#description"></a>
The L-system, View file, and description editors</h4>

<p>These tabs open the text editor on specific files. The L-system
filename defaults to <tt>lsystem.l</tt>, and contains the L-system
used by the model. The View file, by default, is <tt>view.v</tt>; it
describes viewing and rendering parameters. For information about the
format and content of the L-system and View files, see the <cite>Cpfg
User's Manual</cite>. The description file contains a description of the
object; it is called <tt>description.txt</tt>.</p>

<h4>
<a name="#general"></a>
The general text file editor</h4>

<p>The general text file editor lets you edit any text file on the lab
table. It has four more buttons to the right of the <em
class="button">Find</em> button above the text area:</p>

<ul>

<li><img src="images/textopen.png" alt="Open file"><em
class="button">Open file</em>. When you push this button, the current
file (if any) is closed, and a new file opened. If you have changed
the current file, you are asked if you want to save it before it is
closed.  Otherwise, you are presented with a file browser in the lab
table directory.  Choosing a file opens it in the text editor.</li>

<li><img src="images/textclose.png" alt="Close file"><em
class="button">Close file</em>. This button closes the current
file. If you have changed it, you are asked if you want to save it
before closing it.</li>

<li><img src="images/textsave.png" alt="Save file"><em
class="button">Save file</em>. Pressing this button saves the current
file. If the file has no name (that is, if you entered text without
opening a new file), you are prompted to enter a filename.</li>

<li><img src="images/textsaveas.png" alt="Save file as"><em
class="button">Save file as</em>. This button saves the current file
to a new file name, regardless of whether or not it currently has
one. You are prompted for the new name.</li>
</ul>

<p class="warning">
<strong>Note</strong>: The general text file editor lets you edit any
text file on the lab table, including the L-system file, the view
file, and any of the surface, contour, function, and panel
definitions. These files are opened by L-studio when the object is
opened, and written when the object is closed or
<i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i> is run. If you change and save them in the
general text file editor, you must use the command <em
class="menu">Read from lab table</em> from the <em
class="menu">Object</em> menu to explicitly read the file back into the
specific L-studio editor.</p>

<p class="warning">
Also note that if you use the general text file editor to edit a file
which is used in generating the model, but is not a standard
<i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i> file (for instance, a file that is
<code>#include</code>d by the L-system), you will have to explicitly
save it in order for any changes to be used by
<i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i>.</p>
