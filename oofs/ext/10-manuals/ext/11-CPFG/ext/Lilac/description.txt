Syringa vulgaris Congo 3

A variant of the L-system for Congo 3, based on the generic model of a 
polypodial branching structure.

The model uses the following information for each order of branching:

- the sequence of internode lengths on the axis with the largest
  number of internodes.
- the number of internodes in the axes of order o+1 as a function of
  index i of their position on the supporting axis (of order o).

History:

Modeled on May 26, 1994 in Morden, Manitoba according to the raw data 
for Congo 3.  

Reimplemented using recursive decomposition and homomorphisms December 17, 1996.
