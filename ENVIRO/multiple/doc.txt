   Environmental process enabling execution of multiple environmental
	processes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Name of the executable: multiple

Necessary command line parameters: 
   multiple [-k semaphore_key] [-ext comm_files_extension] 
	    -e environment_file specification_file


Commands in specification file:
  verbose:   on/off

  field communication file: field_dot_e_file
	   specification file for a particular environmental process.


Communication:
 Turtle parameters sent to the field: as required by subfields
 Communication symbol:
   n parameters
     to field: 
	1) the index of the field process (according to the order of
	   commands 'field communication file')
	2-n) the rest is send to the specific process (without the first one)

     from field:
	1) stays the same
	2-n) the results coming from the environmental process
        


Algorithm:
  Basically, multiple.c contains slightly modified code from cpfg
(communication.c).
