Monopodial structure with spiral phyllotaxis

Illustrates the use of textures with transparency to model leaves with complex shapes.

This model uses graphically defined functions of time
to control:
- the elongation of internodes,
- the growth of leaves in length and width,
- the branching angles between the stem and the leaves, and
- the gradual changes of leaf colors.
Leaves are modeled using cubic patches, and are arranged into 
a spiral phyllotactic pattern.
Slight orthotropism improves the appearance of the model.
