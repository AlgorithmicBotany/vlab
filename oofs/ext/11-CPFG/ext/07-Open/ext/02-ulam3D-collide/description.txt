L-system implementation of 3D Ulam's model on the cubic grid

This  is a simple example of a 3D model that interacts with
an environment

The axiom initiates four branches, each terminated by 
an apex A.  The apex is decomposed into five 'tentacles' f, 
each terminated by communication module ?E(VIGOR).  
The environment (handled by process 'honda81') returns value 
1 (grow) if there is no collision, and 0 (don't grow)
if there is a collision.  A tentacle that does not collide 
is replaced by a permanent branch segment F with an apex A.
A colliding tentacle remains unchanged.  The communication
module remains at the end of that tentacle, to prevent 
future branches from running into it.
