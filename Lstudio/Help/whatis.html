<h1>What is L-studio?</h1>

     alt="L-studio screenshot"></div>

<p>L-studio is Windows software for creating simulation models and
performing virtual experiments using L-systems. It consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>two L-system&ndash;based <dfn>simulators</dfn>, <i>cpfg</i> and
<i>lpfg</i>;</li>
<li>a set of sample models, primarily of plants, each stored as an
L-studio <dfn>object</dfn>;</li>
<li>a graphical <dfn>browser</dfn> for organizing and accessing objects on
local and remote machines;</li>
<li>a series of <dfn>editors</dfn> and other modeling tools for
creating and modifying objects; and</li>
<li>a library of <dfn>environmental programs</dfn> which simulate
environmental processes that affect plant development.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The simulators <i>cpfg</i> and <i>lpfg</i></h4>

<p>At the heart of L-studio are the simulator programs <i>cpfg</i> and
<i>lpfg</i>. These programs take as input an L-system file, usually
along with one or more related files, 

comprised in an L-studio
object.
The simulators produce a visual representation of the model.
Depending on
the L-system, the models may be animated and/or interactively manipulated.

Optionally, the simulators may also produce various output data files.

<i>cpfg</i> and <i>lpfg</i> share a common interface (L-studio
proper). <i>cpfg</i> is more suitable for the rapid creation of simple
models. <i>lpfg</i> is particularly useful when creating complex
models.


<h4>L-studio objects</h4>

<p>An L-studio object is a set of files kept together in a common
directory. Each of these files specifies one component of the object;
some of these files are required, and some are optional.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <dfn>L-system file</dfn> (<tt>*.l</tt>) is a text file
containing the L-system which will serve as the primary input to
<i>cpfg</i> or <i>lpfg</i>. Every object must have an L-system
file.</li>

<li>The <dfn>view file</dfn> (<tt>*.v</tt>) specifies drawing and
rendering options, as well as other general parameters for <i>cpfg</i>
or <i>lpfg</i>. Every object must have a view file, though it may be
empty.</li>

<li>The <dfn>animation file</dfn> (<tt>*.a</tt>) contains parameters
which define how <i>cpfg</i>/<i>lpfg</i> will animate the
simulation. Every object must have an animation file, though L-studio
will set up a default file automatically.</li>

<li>A <dfn>color map</dfn> (<tt>*.map</tt>) defines a 256-color palette
which is used by the simulator to draw the model in colormap mode.</li>

<li>Alternately, a <dfn>material file</dfn> (<tt>*.mat</tt>) can be
used if the model is rendered with shaded polygons. Every object must
have either a color map or a material file.</li>

<li><dfn>Surfaces</dfn> (<tt>*.s</tt>) are user-defined Bezier surfaces
which can be incorporated into 3D models; for example, to capture
the shape of leaves or flower petals.</li>

<li><dfn>Contours</dfn> (<tt>*.con</tt> or <tt>*.cset</tt>)
are used to describe the axis or cross-section of elongated limbs,
such as stems.</li>

<li><dfn>Functions</dfn> (<tt>*.func</tt> or <tt>*.fset</tt>) are
graphically-defined functions of a single variable that can be
incorporated into L-system models.</li>

<li><dfn>Control panels</dfn> (<tt>*.pnl</tt>) are used to interact
with the model by manipulating parameters, or turning model features
on or off.</li>

<li>An <dfn>environmental communication specification file</dfn>
(<tt>*.e</tt>) defines how the model will communicate with an external
<dfn>environmental program</dfn> (<tt>*.exe</tt>). The environmental
process may optionally use additional input files.</li>

<li>The <dfn>object description</dfn> (<tt>description.txt</tt>) is a
text file which is typically used to describe the object, how it
works, how it was constructed, and so on. All objects must have a
description, though it may be empty.</li>

<li>The <dfn>object specification files</dfn> (<tt>specifications</tt>
and <tt>LSspecifications</tt>) are text files which define
object-specific parameters and are used by L-studio to determine how
to handle each particular object. Under the <abbr>UNIX</abbr>-based
system <i>vlab</i>, the <tt>specifications</tt> file is mandatory;
however, neither file is required in an L-studio object.</li>
</ul>

<p>All L-studio objects will contain an L-system, a view file, an
animation file, an object description, and either a color map or
material file, although these may be empty or contain nothing more
than default values.</p>



<h4>The object browser</h4>

<p>The <dfn>object browser</dfn> is a tool for accessing and navigating
databases of L-studio objects. An object database is stored in an
<dfn>object oriented file system</dfn>, or <dfn>oofs</dfn>. (This
system is <em>object oriented</em> because it uses a
<dfn>prototype-extension</dfn> paradigm; if an object is a refinement
(<em>extension</em>) of another (the <em>prototype</em>), then the
extension is stored in a subdirectory of the prototype.) Using the
browser, you can navigate the oofs and open objects in L-studio.</p>



<h4>Modifying an object in L-studio</h4>

<p>When an object is opened in L-studio, it is copied to a temporary
location called the <dfn>lab table</dfn>. The lab table version can
be experimented upon in any way, and the changes will not be reflected
in the original object until the open object is saved.</p>

<p>When on the lab table, an object's component files can be modified
with L-studio's integrated <dfn>editors</dfn>. L-studio has tools to
edit almost all of the files listed above: text files such as the
L-system or object description; 2D or 3D shape files, such as
surfaces, contours, or functions; color files; panels; and options
files, like the animation file or the object's specifications.</p>



<h4>Environmental programs</h4>

<p>Environmental programs are one object component that is not edited
in L-studio. Instead, these environmental programs must be written in
an external programming language, and the resulting executables placed
somewhere accessible to the object: either in the object's directory,
or in a central environmental program location. L-studio comes with
several useful environmental programs: see the <a
href="enviro.pdf"><cite>User's manual for environmental
programs</cite></a> for more information on them and how to use them.</p>


<h4>More information</h4>
